# ðŸš€Ghibli Image Generator

![Ghibli Image Generator Banner](./ghibli_image.png)  
*Generate Studio Ghibli-style images from text prompts or user-uploaded images!*

The Ghibli Image Generator is a web-based tool that transforms text prompts or uploaded images into artwork inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli style. It uses a combination of Stable Diffusion for text-to-image generation and post-processing techniques to achieve the soft colors, detailed backgrounds, and hand-drawn aesthetic characteristic of Ghibli films. The project is built with Flask for the web interface and can be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access.

## Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Enter a text prompt to generate a Ghibli-style image.
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Upload an image and convert it into the Ghibli style.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly Flask-based interface for interaction.
- **Hugging Face Spaces Deployment**: Easily deploy and share the app online.
- **Customizable**: Modify the style transfer and post-processing to fine-tune the Ghibli aesthetic.

## Demo
A live demo is available on Hugging Face Spaces: [Ghibli Image Generator Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/ghibli-image-generator) 

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A GPU (recommended for faster image generation with Stable Diffusion)
- An account on Hugging Face for deployment

### Local Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adiwanwade/Ghibli-Generator.git
   cd ghibli-image-generator
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   pip install diffusers transformers
   pip install flask pillow accelerate
   ```

4. **Set Up the Directory Structure**
   Ensure the following structure exists:
   ```
   ghibli-image-generator/
   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ static/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/
   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   ```

5. **Run the Application Locally**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the app.
